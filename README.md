# What's For Dinner?

A social site where users can share what they're having for dinner:

Technologies: html, css, node.js, mongodb

Express dependencies:
    "bcrypt": "^3.0.0",
    "ejs": "^2.6.1",
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "express-session": "^1.15.6",
    "method-override": "^2.3.10",
    "moment": "^2.22.2",
    "mongoose": "^5.2.1"
    
 Some user stories:
 1. As a user I can create, edit and delete my account
 2. As a user I can login securely with encrypted password
 3. As a user I can post food that includes name, description and pictures
 4. As a user I can browse other users
 5. As a user I can browse other posts
 6. As a user I can like other posts
 7. As a user I can view all the posts that I've liked
    
 
 Outstanding issues: There's very little user validation for input. Needs to be tested a little more overall.
